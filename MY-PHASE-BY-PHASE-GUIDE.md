# MY PHASE-BY-PHASE DAILY CODING GUIDE — Shree Furniture
## Complete Session Guide | Phase 1 → Phase 4 | Every Prompt Covered
### v1.0 — March 2026 | Aligned with PROMPT-GUIDE-v2.md

---

> **How to use this guide:**
> 1. Find your current phase section below
> 2. Find the next uncompleted prompt (check STATUS.md)
> 3. See the branch to be on, the exact prompt source, what to test, and how to commit
> 4. Work through every prompt in order — never skip
>
> **PROMPT-GUIDE-v2.md is your prompt provider.** This guide tells you WHEN, WHICH, and WHAT TO DO after.

---

## YOUR SESSION LOOP — Every Single Day

```
OPEN THIS GUIDE
    ↓
Find your current phase + next uncompleted prompt
    ↓
git pull + create/switch to the right branch
    ↓
Paste SESSION START prompt (Section 1 of PROMPT-GUIDE-v2.md)
    ↓
Copy build prompt from PROMPT-GUIDE-v2.md → paste → AI generates
    ↓
You test (use the acceptance criteria written inside each prompt)
    ↓
Like it? → commit  |  Don't like it? → rejection flow → rebuild → commit
    ↓
Next prompt in same session OR end of session
    ↓
Paste SESSION END prompt (Section 10 of PROMPT-GUIDE-v2.md) → commit docs → push → PR
```

---

## BEFORE EVERY SESSION — ALWAYS FIRST

### Step 1 — Pull Latest

```bash
git checkout phase/[current-phase]
git pull origin phase/[current-phase]
```

### Step 2 — Paste Session Start Prompt

Open **PROMPT-GUIDE-v2.md → Section 1**.

Use the **"Standard Session Start"** prompt (files 1–5).

> ⚠️ Use this corrected file order — not the order printed in Section 1 of PROMPT-GUIDE-v2:
> `1. STATUS.md → 2. PREFERENCES.md → 3. REJECTIONS.md → 4. STACK-CHANGES.md → 5. CLAUDE.md`

Wait for the summary. Read it. Confirm phase and last completed item match what you expect.

---

## IF YOU WERE INTERRUPTED MID-SESSION

If you had to stop coding mid-session (phone call, power cut, closed laptop):

```bash
git status                    # see what's uncommitted
git stash                     # save uncommitted work temporarily (if needed)
git checkout phase/X-name
git pull origin phase/X-name
git checkout feat/[your-branch]
git stash pop                 # restore your uncommitted work
```

Then paste into Antigravity:

```
Read STATUS.md, PREFERENCES.md, REJECTIONS.md, STACK-CHANGES.md, CLAUDE.md.

I was interrupted mid-session. Tell me:
- What was the last completed item in STATUS.md?
- What was I building when I stopped? (check any uncommitted files)
- What should I do next?
Do not write any code yet.
```

---

## IF YOU STOPPED MID-PROMPT (AI was generating, you had to close)

The AI was building something and you had to close Antigravity without the prompt finishing.

```bash
git status    # were any files actually written?
```

If files were written → inspect them. Are they complete?
- If complete → test them, commit if they pass
- If partial/broken → delete and re-run the prompt from scratch

Paste into Antigravity:
```
The last session was interrupted while building [what you were building].
Read STATUS.md — is [ComponentName] marked as done or in progress?
If in progress: show me the current state of [filepath] and tell me what's missing.
Do not regenerate anything until I confirm.
```

> "Does this feel warm, premium, trustworthy — like a furniture showroom?"
> "Would a first-time buyer trust this to spend ₹40,000 here?"
> If no → use the rejection flow below before committing.

**Rejection flow (run after testing any UI component):**
```
I don't like [what was built for ComponentName].
Specifically: [precise description]
What I want instead: [precise direction]
1. Add to REJECTIONS.md Section 1 with today's date

Read STATUS.md and list all Phase 2 components that are still ⬜ NOT STARTED.
List them in the order they should be built, per NewDocs/10-development-phases.md.
```

### "I don't like the design direction after several components are built"

```
I want to change the overall visual direction of the storefront.
My new preference: [describe the change — e.g. "more whitespace", "darker CTAs"]

2. List every ✅ DONE component in STATUS.md that needs to be updated
3. Do NOT update anything yet — just show me the impact list

# Using Postman or browser:
# POST /store/wishlist  (with session cookie) → adds item
# GET /store/wishlist   → returns items
# DELETE /store/wishlist/[id] → removes item
```

### PROMPT 52 — Build ISR Revalidation Endpoint

**Branch:**
```bash
git checkout phase/3-transactions && git pull
git checkout -b feat/isr-revalidation
```

**Source:** PROMPT-GUIDE-v2.md → Section 5 → **"Build ISR Revalidation Endpoint"**

**What the AI will create:**
- `app/api/revalidate/route.ts`

**You test:**
```bash
curl -X POST localhost:3000/api/revalidate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"secret":"[REVALIDATION_SECRET]","path":"/products/oslo-sofa"}'
# Should return: { "revalidated": true, "paths": ["/products/oslo-sofa"] }
```
- [ ] Wrong secret → returns 401
- [ ] Correct secret → `revalidatePath()` called

**Commit:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: build ISR revalidation endpoint with secret validation"
```

**PR:** Push → PR → `phase/3-transactions`

## PHASE 3 COMPLETE — FULL PURCHASE FLOW TEST

Before merging Phase 3 to develop, manually walk through the **entire purchase flow**:

```
Browse homepage → click Living Room → click product → select variant → Add to Cart
→ Cart drawer opens → Proceed to Checkout → fill address → continue → select shipping
→ continue → Place Order (sandbox) → see confirmation page → check email
```

Every step must work. If anything fails → go to Part 6 of this guide (debugging).

```bash
# Only when all flows pass:
# GitHub → PR: phase/3-transactions → develop
```

## PHASE 3 — INTERRUPTION & RESUME GUIDE

### "I need to stop mid-checkout build"

## Section 9 — DevOps & CI/CD Prompts

These come from **PROMPT-GUIDE-v2.md → Section 9**. Use them whenever you're dealing with deployments, CI failures, or environment variables — at any phase.

---

### Deploy Storefront to Vercel (First Time — Phase 4)

**Branch:** Inside `feat/analytics-security-perf` or its own `feat/vercel-deploy`

**Source:** PROMPT-GUIDE-v2.md → Section 9 → **"Deploy to Vercel (First Time)"**

Paste into Antigravity:
```
@devops-engineer Set up the Vercel deployment for apps/storefront.
Ref: NewDocs/11-environment-and-devops.md.
Configure:
- Link monorepo root to Vercel project
- Set Root Directory: apps/storefront
- Framework Preset: Next.js
- Build Command: cd ../.. && pnpm build --filter=storefront
- Install Command: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
- Add all NEXT_PUBLIC_ env vars from .env.example
- Add all server-only env vars from .env.example
- Enable Vercel Analytics (for Core Web Vitals)
Create .github/workflows/deploy.yml for auto-deploy on merge to main.
Update STATUS.md when done.
```

**You test:**
- [ ] Vercel preview URL loads the storefront
- [ ] No build errors in Vercel dashboard
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL` points to Railway backend URL

**Commit:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "chore: configure Vercel deployment with monorepo root dir and env vars"
```

---

### Deploy Backend to Railway (First Time — Phase 4)

**Source:** PROMPT-GUIDE-v2.md → Section 9 → **"Deploy Backend to Railway (First Time)"**

Paste into Antigravity:
```
@devops-engineer Set up Railway deployment for the MedusaJS v2 backend.
Configure:
- Service name: shree-furniture-backend
- Root directory: backend/
- Build command: pnpm install && pnpm build
- Start command: node_modules/.bin/medusa start
- Health check path: /health
- Add all backend env vars from .env.example
- Post-deploy command: npx medusa db:migrate
Create .github/workflows/deploy.yml Railway deploy step (after Vercel deploy succeeds).
Update STATUS.md when done.
```

**You test:**
- [ ] `GET https://[railway-url]/health` → returns 200
- [ ] `GET https://[railway-url]/store/products` → returns products
- [ ] Medusa Admin at `https://[railway-url]/app/admin` → loads

**Commit:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "chore: configure Railway deployment for MedusaJS v2 backend"
```

---

### When CI Pipeline Fails

**Source:** PROMPT-GUIDE-v2.md → Section 9 → **"Debug CI Pipeline Failure"**

Paste into Antigravity (filling in the brackets):
```
@devops-engineer The GitHub Actions CI pipeline is failing.
Workflow: .github/workflows/ci.yml
Failed step: [which step: tsc / lint / test / build]
Error output: [paste the error log from GitHub Actions]
Branch: [branch name]
Check: are all required secrets set in GitHub Secrets? (TURBO_TOKEN if using remote cache)
```

**Common fixes:**
- `tsc` fails → TypeScript error in a file. Fix and push.
- `lint` fails → ESLint error. Run `pnpm lint` locally to see the exact line.
- `test` fails → a Vitest test broke. Run `pnpm test` locally.
- `build` fails → Next.js build error. Run `pnpm build` locally.

---

### Adding a New Environment Variable (Any Phase)

**Source:** PROMPT-GUIDE-v2.md → Section 9 → **"Add a New Environment Variable"**

Paste into Antigravity:
```
@devops-engineer I need to add a new environment variable: [VAR_NAME]
Value type: [public browser-safe / server-only secret]

1. Add to .env.example with a comment explaining what it is
2. If NEXT_PUBLIC_: add prefix; if server-only: no prefix
3. Add to apps/storefront/.env.local (dev) or backend/.env (dev) with placeholder
4. Add to .github/workflows/ci.yml env section if needed for CI
5. Document: add to Vercel dashboard (storefront) or Railway dashboard (backend)
6. Update NewDocs/11-environment-and-devops.md if it documents env vars
```

**Commit:**
```bash
git add .env.example .github/workflows/ci.yml
git commit -m "chore: add [VAR_NAME] env var to .env.example, CI, and docs"
```

---

## Section 10 — Session End (Exact Prompts)

**Source:** PROMPT-GUIDE-v2.md → Section 10. Use one of these every single session before closing.

### Standard Session End

Paste this at end of every session:
```
End of session. Before updating docs, do a full audit:

1. List every file you created or modified this session (full paths)
2. For each file: is it complete and functional, or partial?
3. Now update STATUS.md:
   - Mark completed items ✅ with a Notes entry describing the implementation
   - Mark partial items 🚧 with exactly what's left to do
   - If anything was started but not in STATUS.md's table, flag it
4. Update KNOWN-ISSUES.md if any unexpected behavior was found
5. Update PREFERENCES.md if I expressed any design preference
6. Update REJECTIONS.md if I rejected anything

Show me a summary of all changes before committing.
```

Then commit:
```bash
git add STATUS.md PREFERENCES.md REJECTIONS.md NewDocs/KNOWN-ISSUES.md
git commit -m "docs: end of session — STATUS, PREFERENCES, REJECTIONS, KNOWN-ISSUES"
git push
```

### Session End With a Note for Next Session (Use When Something Is Half-Done)

```
End of session. Before updating docs, do a full audit:

1. List every file you created or modified this session (full paths)
2. For each file: is it complete and functional, or partial?
3. Now update STATUS.md:
   - Mark [component] as ✅ DONE with a Notes entry
   - Add note: "[what the next session needs to know about this implementation]"
   - Mark partial items 🚧 with exactly what's left to do
4. Update KNOWN-ISSUES.md if any unexpected behavior was found
5. Update PREFERENCES.md if I confirmed a design decision today
6. Update REJECTIONS.md if I rejected an approach today

Show me a summary of all changes before committing.
```

**Example note in STATUS.md:**
```
ProductCard ✅ DONE
Note: "Uses optimistic update from cart-store. Hover uses translateY(-2px) shadow — see PREFERENCES.md Section 4."
```

## Section 11 — Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Say to the AI)

**Source:** PROMPT-GUIDE-v2.md → Section 11

These are prompts that will get you bad or wrong results. Avoid all of them.

| ❌ Never say this | ✅ Say this instead |
|---|---|
| `"Build me a backend"` | `"@backend-specialist Build [specific file] per NewDocs/06-api-contracts.md section [X]"` |
| `"Make a nice UI"` | `"@frontend-specialist Build [ComponentName] per NewDocs/01 section [X]"` |
| `"Use Prisma for the database"` | Never override the ORM — fixed in DECISIONS.md |
| `"Add reviews while you're here"` | Reviews are OUT of scope. Check NewDocs/09-engineering-scope-definition.md first |
| `"Just use any type here"` | `"Use unknown + type guard"` |
| `"Store the token in localStorage"` | HTTP-only cookies only. ADR-009. |
| `"Use floats for price"` | Paise integers only. ADR-007. `4999900` not `49999.00` |
| `"Build a custom cart"` | Medusa Cart Module handles this. Never rebuild it. |
| `"Fix everything"` | One file, one problem at a time |
| Long vague descriptions | Short + file path + NewDocs section reference |
| Forgetting "Update STATUS.md" | Always append it to every build prompt |

## Session Start Prompt (Corrected Order)

```
Read these files before doing anything:
1. STATUS.md
2. PREFERENCES.md
3. REJECTIONS.md
4. STACK-CHANGES.md
5. CLAUDE.md

Tell me: current phase, last completed item, next 2–3 tasks.
Do not write any code yet.
```

## Session End Prompt

Open **PROMPT-GUIDE-v2.md → Section 10** → copy **"Standard Session End"**.

Then commit:
```bash
git add STATUS.md PREFERENCES.md REJECTIONS.md NewDocs/KNOWN-ISSUES.md
git commit -m "docs: end of session — STATUS, PREFERENCES, REJECTIONS, KNOWN-ISSUES"
git push
```

## If You Don't Like What Was Built

```
I don't like [ComponentName]: [what specifically]
I want instead: [what]
1. Add to REJECTIONS.md Section [1/2/3/4/5]
2. Rebuild [ComponentName]
3. Update STATUS.md
```

## If You Want to Save a Preference

```
Add to PREFERENCES.md Section [2/3/4/5]:
Element: [name]
What I liked: [description]
What I want different: [description]
Date: [today]
```

## Debugging

Open **PROMPT-GUIDE-v2.md → Section 8** → find matching scenario.

## Stack Change

See CHANGE-GUIDE.md for the full protocol. Short version:
```bash
git checkout -b chore/swap-[old]-to-[new]
```
Then: impact assessment → document in STACK-CHANGES.md → migrate one component at a time → update all reference files → PR to `develop`.
