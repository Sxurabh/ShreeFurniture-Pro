## Step 3 — Navigate to the Right Doc Before Making Changes

| Change Type | Read This First |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Database / schema | [Database Schema](../architecture/database-schema.md) |
| API / server actions | [API Contracts](../architecture/api-contracts.md) |
| Business logic | [Computation Logic Engine Spec](../engineering/computation-logic-engine-spec.md) |
| Architecture decisions | [System Architecture](../architecture/system-architecture.md) |
| File/folder structure | [Monorepo Structure](../engineering/monorepo-structure.md) |
| UI components | [AI Coding Standards](./ai-coding-standards.md) |
| Environment variables | [/.env.example](../../.env.example) |
| Auth/security patterns | [Architecture Doc — Security](../source-of-truth/04-architecture-document.md#5-security-architecture) |
| Deployment | [Environment & DevOps](../devops/environment-and-devops.md) |

## NEVER

- Invent database fields not in [Database Schema](../architecture/database-schema.md)
- Create API endpoints not in [API Contracts](../architecture/api-contracts.md)
- Bypass RLS security
- Move business logic to client components
- Edit `/src/types/database.ts` manually — it is auto-generated via `supabase gen types`
- Re-litigate decisions listed in [decisions.md](./decisions.md)
